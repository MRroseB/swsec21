If you are deploying this lab on your own Linux machine, you need to set the lab's hostnames to localhost.

You can add the following lines to `/etc/hosts`:
```
# For CSRF Lab
10.9.0.5        www.csrflabelgg.com
10.9.0.5        www.csrflab-defense.com
10.9.0.105      www.csrflab-attacker.com
```

Changing and saving the file will have immediate effect.
