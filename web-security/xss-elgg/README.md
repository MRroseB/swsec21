If you are deploying this lab on your own Linux machine, you need to set the lab's hostnames to localhost.

You can add the following lines to `/etc/hosts`:
```
# For XSS Lab
10.9.0.5        www.xsslabelgg.com
10.9.0.5        www.example32a.com
10.9.0.5        www.example32b.com
10.9.0.5        www.example32c.com
10.9.0.5        www.example60.com
10.9.0.5        www.example70.com
```

Changing and saving the file will have immediate effect.
